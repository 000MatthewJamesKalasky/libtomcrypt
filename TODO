For 1.07

                
1. [3 hours]    ASN.1 SET and T61String [punishment, add UTF8 to the list!]

4. [short]      Make parameters in descriptors common, e.g. cipher.block_length => cipher.block_size, hash.blocksize => hash.block_size

DONE
----

0. [important]  Make ciphers enc/dec routines return int [for accel].  Make the ciphers themselves return CRYPT_OK [default] *AND* make
                all dependent code check the returns 
                [x] gcm
                [x] ccm
                [x] yarrow
                [x] fortuna
                [x] eax
                [x] ocb
                [x] omac
                [x] pmac
                [x] pelican
                [x] ctr
                [x] cbc
                [x] ecb
                [x] cfb
                [x] ofb

2. [many]       ASN.1 flexidecoder.  Basically decode and construct a list of decoded ASN.1 types on the fly.
                This will allow easy decoding of things like X.509 as their orders can be "screwed up".
                The concept is simple, just read the ID byte and use a linked list.  I'll do this after step #1.

3. [short]      Make the cipher/hash accelerators return int [not void] to signal errors.  Whoops

5. [short]      Swap arguments of MGF1 around so hash_idx is first

6. [longish]    Re-write parts of the ECC api, re-factor the code, convert to w-NAF, add FP support, add ecc point verifier

7. [shortish]   Provide DH for the DSA code e.g. dsa_encrypt_key()

8. [worthit]    Move the ECC code for point mul and what not as symbols that the TFM/LTM descriptors link in.  Means a change to the hierarchy.  This allows
                code that uses ECC plugins to simply ignore this code [e.g. save space]

9. [short]      Document the flexi decoder and how it relates to the other DER routines
