Things ideal for 1.05

- ASN.1 SET and UTCtime and CHOICE (hint for choice do it as a sep list and just use error codes to know when you got a hit)
- Start working towards making the bignum code plugable
- Add OID for ciphers and PRNGs to their descriptors
- Document the ASN.1 a bit more verbosely ;-)
- Some ASN.1 demo programs [for now read the source code!]
- export ECC functions globally
- Look into other ECC point muls and consider a "precomp" interface
